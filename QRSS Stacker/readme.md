# QRSS Stacker

**QRSS Stacker is designed to assist in the extraction of QRSS signals so weak that they canâ€™t be easily decoded by looking at the captures.** This program works by loading a stitched image (created by the QRSS Stitcher) and allowing the user to overlap fragments of the image on top of itself repeatedly. The idea is that by averaging the repeated captures, the random nature of noise causes it to be cancelled-out, and the weak signal becomes readable.
