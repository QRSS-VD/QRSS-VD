# QRSS Stacker

**QRSS Stitcher can look at a folder filled with hundreds of captures (from Argo, Spectran, QRSS VD, or other QRSS grabber software) and assemble individual images into a single, extremely wide, continuous image.** If your original captures have scale bars, logos, or even title bars and menus around the image data, this program can help trim it off so your final stitched image contains smooth, continuous data!
